### Planned Future Enhancements
Immediate fixes 
- First and forement I will be fixing auth so that users can login to use the app
- I will be implementing a sum of all calories consumed so users know their daily total 
- Savings meals by date will be implemented 
- Will fix the update function to run properly 
- The UI can definitely be improved a lot 

Near future updates
- Macros will be able to be assigned to foods 
- A tally of daily macros consumed will be available
- You will be able to view previous days
- Users will be able to set their daily calorie and macro goals and see how close they are to hitting them 

Icebox features
- I would like to connect this to the MyFitnessPal API and have access to their database of foods 
- The ability to track you weight and log you fitness journey is something I am considering 
- Graphs to help users visualize their calorie and macro intake 
- Graphs to help users visualise their wieght loss pattern and potentially extrapulate 
- A BMI calculator where users can see what their BMI is
